Adaptive force generation for preicision-grip lifting by a spectral timing model of the cerebellum

The “Adaptive force generation for precision-grip lifting by a spectral timing model of the cerebellum” by Ulloa, A., Bullock, D., and Rhodes, B, illustrates how the process of grasping and lifting an object is controlled. The agent must apply a weight and texture dependent grip force that applies the minimal amount of pressure to hold the object, while also applying the appropriate load force to either lift, or lower the object. The model explains this phenomena through the process of learned slip-compensation mediated by the cerebellum.

While the system is quite extensive, it is broken down into three manageable subsytems, and after understanding this analysis one will have a detailed understanding of how grip control works, a concept which can be appleid to many other motor learning processes.
