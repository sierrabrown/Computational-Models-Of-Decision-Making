This folder contains a step-by-step analysis of three neural models implemented in matlab. Includes both an analysis of the scientific theory behind the model and of the code itself.

1. AI Maze

	This model simulates learning which occurs in the ventral striatum and amygdala, by assigning a positive or negative reward value to each possible move the 'rat' has available. 



2. Feedback Control



	Thi model explores the effects of feedback on action control. Unlike in robotics, the length of nerves causes transmission of signals to be slow and therefore necessitates a feedback control system, the strength of which greatly determines ones ability to learn precise movements.
	
	While we have established that negative feedback control will not produce perfect movements due to lags, gains, and a level of non-elimnable error at the end of the process, we will explore how exactly it is that the feedback lag values affect performance.

3. Adaptive force generation for preicision-grip lifting by a spectral timing model of the cerebellum

	The “Adaptive force generation for precision-grip lifting by a spectral timing model of the cerebellum” by Ulloa, A., Bullock, D., and Rhodes, B, illustrates how the process of grasping and lifting an object is controlled. The agent must apply a weight and texture dependent grip force that applies the minimal amount of pressure to hold the object, while also applying the appropriate load force to either lift, or lower the object. The model explains this phenomena through the process of learned slip-compensation mediated by the cerebellum.
